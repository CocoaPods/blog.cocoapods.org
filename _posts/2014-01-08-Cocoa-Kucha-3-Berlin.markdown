And just like that the next Cocoa Kucha was declared. As part of a world-wide community 
outreach program I've been in talks with [Chris Eidhof](http://chris.eidhof.nl) and [Engin Kurutepe](http://www.kurutepe.com) 
about running a Cocoa Kucha with the [CocoaHeads Berlin](http://cocoaheads-berlin.github.io).

<!-- more -->

Like with the other Kuchas, this meetup is in the style of [Pecha
Kucha](http://www.pechakucha.org/faq) where there are 8 speakers doing short
talks related to Objective-C for 6 minutes and 20 seconds. The speaker must go
though 20 slides, 20 seconds per slide. This keeps them to the point and makes
it a lot easier for people to get started.

As the timeframe for the event is smaller than I normally plan, I'd like to open the doors to speakers. 
[We accept pull requests including yourself on the roster](https://github.com/CocoaPods/blog.cocoapods.org/pull/8). Like most CocoaHead Berlin events is hosted at [CodeKollektiv](http://www.codekollektiv.de/) and starts at 19h. Add it to your kalendar.

Currently confirmed for the 22nd:
