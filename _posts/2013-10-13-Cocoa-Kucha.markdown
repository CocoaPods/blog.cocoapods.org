CocoaPods is more than just a tool, CocoaPods is a community of over a thousand [commiters](https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs/graphs/contributors), six thousand Podspecs and hundreds of thousands of [users](http://rubygems.org/gems/cocoapods). To say the community is growing is a mild [understatement](https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs/graphs/code-frequency). One of the cool things about a big community is that there's the chance that people will get clumped enough together to make meeting up and sharing ideas a possible. I'd like to announce our first attempt at trying to bring people together, starting in New York City this November.

Cocoa Kucha is a meetup in the style of [Pecha Kucha](http://www.pechakucha.org/faq). The idea is we get 8 people to talk about a topic related to Objective-C for 6 minutes and 20 seconds. 20 slides at 20 seconds. Mix that with some drinks and conversation and I think we've got a nice evening.

The format of a Pecha Kuchas makes it a great way to start experimenting with public speaking. The first time I spoke publicy was at a Pecha Kucha on [folk dancing](https://github.com/orta/pechakucha/tree/1b92dd66d13654b7aa3024ced2ec6d052bfe6b1d) in the UK, and then later on the history of the game [monopoly](http://orta.github.io/pechakucha/). At this point I'd like to open invites for people to talk, currently all of the slots are open and I will edit this post when all the slots are closed. 

If you're interested in speaking, drop an email to [orta@cocoapods.org](mailto:orta@cocoapods.org). You can join our [NYC meetup group](http://www.meetup.com/CocoaPods-NYC/) to keep up to date, and the event will allow RSVPs 2 weeks before on the 6th Nov. Thanks to [@W5mith](http://twitter.com/W5mith) & [meetup.com](http://meetup.com) for hosting us this time.

Currently confirmed for the 20th
