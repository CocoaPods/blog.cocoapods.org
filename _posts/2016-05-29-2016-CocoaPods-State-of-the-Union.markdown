Apple have their annual WWDC keynote and Developer State of the Union.
We have ours.
We're planning a great opening event to WWDC week: The CocoaPods Alt State of the Union.
You should join us, and hear about what's happened in CocoaPods in the past year, and what's to come in the next. This year's is going to be extra-special, as we'll all get to celebrate the release of CocoaPods 1.0 together ðŸŽ‰

It's become an annual tradition for CocoaPods to host [an](http://www.eventbrite.com/e/cocoapods-2nd-annual-wwdc-meetup-tickets-6887230893) [event](https://blog.cocoapods.org/CocoaPods-WWDC-Party) [at](https://blog.cocoapods.org/2015-CocoaPods-State-of-the-Union) WWDC,
and we want to make this another great one.
Last year, we tried out a new [lottery system](https://github.com/CocoaPods/sotu.cocoapods.org), and we'll be using it again this year. To register, just go to [https://sotu.cocoapods.org](https://sotu.cocoapods.org) and authenticate with GitHub.

Registration is open to everyone with a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account. [Twilio](https://citymapper.com/go/6jm7vo) have graciously offered to host us again this year, June Thirteenth (Monday) at 6:30 PM, and we can't wait to see you all!

All of the details, as well as the lottery registration link, are available at [https://sotu.cocoapods.org/](https://sotu.cocoapods.org/). We'll be closing the lottery and announcing the lucky entrants in one week (on June 5th), so hurry up and register!
