I'm very happy to announce that [Emerge Tools](https://www.emergetools.com) is now sponsoring the web hosting costs of CocoaPods!

We're super thankful that Emerge is stepping in to help us out with this. CocoaPods.org, Trunk, and all the other websites we maintain are a critical part of the CocoaPods ecosystem, and we're glad to have Emerge's support to keep them running.

Emerge Tools is a suite of revolutionary products designed to supercharge mobile apps and the teams that build them. They're a small startup working in a space that is near and dear to our hearts, and when they heard that the CocoaPods maintainers had been paying for hosting out-of-pocket for years, they were eager to step up and help out.
